# Patterns in UFO Sightings

**Description:**
The dataset I'm using is called "UFO Sightings" and includes data on the location, time, duration, and description of the UFO sighting. It also includes the shape of the UFO.  I am interested in researching these following questions,
* Is there a pattern among the most common times and location of UFO sightings?
* Is there a common theme with the locations that have the most common UFO sightings?
* Does the duration of the UFO sighting play an important role?
* Do these patterns imply that these UFO sightings can be credible or debunked?
* How have UFO sightings changed over time?

This repository contains the README file, requirements text file, and my final project notebook.
